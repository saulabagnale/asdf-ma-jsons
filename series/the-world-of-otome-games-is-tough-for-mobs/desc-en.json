It was as if men were just livestock that served as stepping stones for females in this world. The only exceptions were the game’s romantic targets, a group of handsome men led by the crown prince. In these bizarre circumstances, Leon held one weapon: his knowledge from his previous world, where his brazen sister had forced him to complete this game. This is a story about his adventure to survive and thrive in this world.","genres":"Action, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Isekai, Mecha, Romance, Sci-Fi","themes":"Harem, Reincarnation, School Life, Video Games, Ecchi","uploadDate":1608826720092}
