Shut up and live like the dead.”\n\nEbony Vonieck is a convicted felon for the murder of her fiancé and father. While waiting for her execution in prison, she is suddenly released from her hell when she is informed that the progressive Archduke of Schneider Castle is waiting for her. Broken by her imprisonment, resigned to the charges against her, and expecting her life to become a living hell, what awaits her instead is a household of warm employees and servants. Ebony has no idea that the Archduke will help change her life, and make use of her drive to change the chauvinistic social system of the Kingdom of Kalcass that condemned her to die for a crime she didn't commit.","genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"themes":[],"uploadDate":1648618312133}
