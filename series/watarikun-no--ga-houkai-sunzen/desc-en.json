He forgoes club activities for the sake of spending time with her, leading many of his peers to label him a siscon. But as long as his sister's happy, Nao is willing to shut out any unwelcome comments about himself.\n\nUnbeknownst to Nao, however, a greater danger has resurfaced - one that destroyed his way of life six years ago, and threatens to do so once again.\n\nAnd that danger, in the form of a girl wielding a garden hoe, will stop at nothing to reclaim what could once have been hers, and hers alone.","genres":["Comedy","Drama","Psychological","Romance","Slice of Life"],"themes":["Harem","School Life"],"uploadDate":1636890129582}
