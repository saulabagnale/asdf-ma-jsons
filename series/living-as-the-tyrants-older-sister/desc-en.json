The beauty I see in front of the mirror is the future tyrant's older sister, Alicia! She's not even a protagonist or an antagonist, but a character that doesn't appear much and gets beheaded by her (future) tyrant little brother. My life is all about escaping that fate from the novel. In the end, I seduced the male lead's merchant friend who also doesn't appear much and was about to leave the country with him. How-e-ver– The face of the man who spent the night with me was extraordinary.\n\n\"I-I'm pretty sure the name I heard yesterday wasn't that name but something else. Uhm, what was it. I-I think it's Sir Lancelot.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's my friend.\"\n\n\"…\"\n\n\"Why, is there a problem?\"\n\nExcuse me, you're asking if there's a problem? A lot. There are a lot of problems with that.\n\n…Why is the male lead on my bed?!\n\nBased on the Original","genres":["Comedy","Fantasy","Isekai","Romance"],"themes":["Military","Villainess"],"uploadDate":1636889510462}
