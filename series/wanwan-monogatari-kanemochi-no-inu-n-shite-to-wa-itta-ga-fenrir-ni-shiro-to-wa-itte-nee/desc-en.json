Just before dying, the man thought that if he was reincarnated, he would want to live the lazy life of a rich man's dog. His wish is granted, but it doesn't turn out the way he anticipated. He comes back to life in another world as Rōta, a dog who belongs to the daughter of an extremely wealthy person. However, at just one month old, he is easily larger than a human, and he realizes he is no ordinary dog.","genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy","Isekai","Slice of Life"],"themes":["Animals","Loli","Reincarnation"],"uploadDate":1638906710036}
