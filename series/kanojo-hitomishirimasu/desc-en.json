Even simple things, like going for a donut with someone or calling out to a stranger that they've dropped something, paralyze her with fear. Her strategy? Become a \"rent-a-girlfriend\" and make some cash while she practices her people skills! But raising the stakes even higher might not be the foolproof solution she thought it was...

How is that even possible?!","genres":["Comedy","Romance","Slice of Life"],"themes":["School Life"],"uploadDate":1647283165033}
