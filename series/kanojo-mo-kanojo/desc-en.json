However, just as he tries to commit himself to this relationship, he receives an abrupt confession from Nagisa Minase.\n\nAt first, Naoya tries to reject her but is soon overcome by feelings of not wanting to hurt Nagisa. Trying to avoid betraying his girlfriend's trust in him, Naoya thinks up a \"solution\" to make both girls happy—two-timing. Naturally, Saki rebuffs this idea, but through Naoya's and Nagisa's persistence, she reluctantly submits.\n\nWith this, a three-way affair begins between Naoya, his girlfriend, and his \"other\" girlfriend, as they develop a relationship that deviates from the social norm.","genres":["Comedy","Romance","Slice of Life"],"themes":["Harem","School Life"],"uploadDate":1637903409116}
