Of course, in his case, the “world” is an enormous dungeon filled with monsters below a city run by gods and goddesses with way too much time on their hands. He's got big dreams but not much more when a roll on the random encounter die brings him face-to-face with the girl of his dreams—but what's an amateur adventurer got to offer a brilliant swords woman? And what if the lonely goddess who sponsors his solo adventuring gets jealous?","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"themes":["Harem","Magic"],"uploadDate":1635631472515}
